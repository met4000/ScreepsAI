# ScreepsAI
Guess what. This is (Hopefully. Maybe?) an AI for Screeps! - Note to future self; make this a better description and also kill past self

Notes:
- cli.js contains cli helper functions
- creeps.js contains functions for managing creeps
- consts.js is some constants loaded into (almost?) every file I use (at the top in 3 lines)
- conveyer role is unfinished
- transferer and stagnant roles are WIP/working - ish
- upgrader role is a placeholder
